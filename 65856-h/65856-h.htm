<div class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</div>
<p class="tb">The son of Albert R. and Mary E. (Hare) Edwards, Linden
Forest Edwards was born in Lewisville, Ohio, on November 25,
1899. He received the bachelor of arts degree in 1922 and the
master of science degree in 1923 from Ohio State University. Dr.
Edwards continued graduate study at the University of Michigan,
the University of Illinois, and Ohio State University. In 1928 the
degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred on Linden Edwards
by Ohio State University.</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards has had considerable experience in the teaching
profession. His former positions follow: instructor in zoology,
Ohio State University, 1923-25; instructor in anatomy, University
of Illinois, 1925-29. Since 1929 he has served in various capacities
in the College of Medicine at Ohio State University.</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards is a member of the following professional
organizations: International Association for Dental Research,
American Association of Anatomists, Ohio Academy of Science,
Columbus Dental Society, American Association of the History of
Medicine, and the Franklin County (Ohio) Historical Society. He
was a member of Sigma Xi, Omicron Kappa Upsilon, and Gamma
Alpha. He is also a past president of the Ohio Academy of Medical
History.</p>
<p>Linden F. Edwards has published several books: ANATOMY
FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION, CONCISE ANATOMY, and SYNOPSIS
OF ANATOMY. He has also written the chapter entitled &ldquo;Anatomy&rdquo;
in Trapozzano&rsquo;s REVIEW OF DENTISTRY FOR STATE BOARD
EXAMINATIONS and has coauthored the chapter entitled &ldquo;The
Maxillary Sinus&rdquo; in Orban&rsquo;s ORAL HISTOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY.
He has also published scientific papers in the field of human
anatomy. In recent years he has developed an interest in the
history of medicine, particularly in the history of anatomy.</p>
<p>Dr. Edwards married Elizabeth Smith on September 2, 1925,
and has one daughter. He currently holds the post of professor
of anatomy in the College of Medicine at Ohio State University.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<p class="tb">For the sake of accuracy and to be truly interpretative
the historical account of any era should include a record of
the evil deeds of disreputable characters as well as the good
deeds of honorable ones, albeit the tendency is to disregard
the former in order to glorify the latter, because of their
greater appeal to the pride and esteem of their fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>The medical colleges and the good citizens of Cincinnati
during the nineteenth century could well boast of their
outstanding professors of anatomy, such notables for example,
as Doctors Cilley, Clendenin, Cobb, Comegys, Gobrecht,
Gross, Judkins and others too numerous to mention&mdash;names
which still grace the rolls of &ldquo;Ohio&rsquo;s Medical Hall of Fame.&rdquo;
It is not the object of this paper to detract one iota from the
laurels of these professors of anatomy; rather, the purpose
is to depict some of the deeds and something of the character
of a villainous individual by the name of William Cunningham,
a &ldquo;professional resurrectionist,&rdquo; upon whom the professors
relied for procuring their anatomical material.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">THE DRAY-MAN BOGEYMAN</span></h2>
<p>More stories were told about Cunningham than of any
other of the resurrectionists in Ohio, of his grave robbing
episodes and of his escapades in eluding law officers. He
was the bogeyman of all ill-behaved children in the environs
of Cincinnati during the period when he plied his trade in
corpses, which was between the years 1855 and 1871. He
was known locally by various names, including Old Man Dead
and The Ghoul, but he was more familiarly called &ldquo;Old Cunny,&rdquo;
not simply because it was a contraction of his real name
but since he was as cunning as the proverbial fox, and due
to his adroitness and daring, he was deserving of the cognomen.</p>
<p>He was born in Ireland in 1807 and is described as
having been a big raw-boned man with muscles like Hercules,
a protruding lower jaw and an insatiable thirst for hard liquor.
During the day he was ostensibly a dray-man, but at
night he plied his trade as a professional resurrectionist,
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
supplying the medical colleges of Cincinnati with cadavers
which he and his hired helpers exhumed from the local cemeteries.</p>
<p>According to a Cincinnati physician, who knew him in
a business way, &ldquo;Cunny was an expert in his business....
Usually he took the body to town in a buggy sitting in the seat
beside him. The corpse was dressed up in an old coat, vest
and hat. He would hold the reins in his right hand while he
would steady the corpse with his left arm around the waist
of his silent companion. Whenever people passed and the
corpse would gravitate forward and downward Cunny would
slap his inoffensive partner in the face and say to him &lsquo;Sit
up! This is the last time I am going to take you home when
you get drunk. The idea of a man with a family disgracing
himself in this way!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">OLD CUNNY&rsquo;S CUNNINGNESS</span></h2>
<p>Illustrative of Old Cunny&rsquo;s cleverness are the following
incidents related about him. One night between the hours
of eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock he and two of his confederates
stopped at a saloon in Carthage to have a drink. His identity
being known by almost everyone in the environs of Cincinnati
and his nightly movements always arousing suspicion, after
he and his helpers had departed several of the patrons of the
saloon organized themselves into a posse and proceeded to
follow the ghouls to the cemetery used by the City Infirmary
in the rear of that institution. The party in pursuit surrounded
the cemetery just as the ghouls were in the act of
raising two subjects from their graves and commenced firing
promiscuously at them. His two helpers escaped into an adjoining
woods but Old Cunny stood his grounds and obstinately
refused to obey the command to hold up his hands. Finally
when one of the members of the party drew a bead on him
with a rifle which failed to go off when the cap snapped he
reluctantly gave himself up and begged them to spare his
life.</p>
<p>Old Cunny was then piled into his conveyance and accompanied
by his captors was forced to drive back to Carthage.
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
On their return to that village, he persuaded his captors
to stop at the saloon where he bought them several
drinks. When they were properly mellowed, he was released
and permitted to return to Cincinnati with his empty wagon.
However, instead of continuing toward that city, he circumvented
the route and returned to the cemetery, during which
time his doughty captors merrily dispersed to their homes.
Meanwhile, his helpers, having been well trained in their duty,
had returned to the scene of their ghoulish task, had hooked
the two subjects from their graves, and placed them in sacks
all ready for transportation to one of the medical colleges.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">TWO BODIES TWICE SNATCHED</span></h2>
<p>On another occasion, he and two of his helpers were
apprehended on Reading Road near Walnut Hills with their
booty which consisted of two bodies which they had just exhumed
from a cemetery near Hartley and were concealed in
gunny sacks. The three were immediately placed under arrest
and taken to the Ninth Street police station and the bodies
were delivered to a near-by funeral establishment for subsequent
identification.</p>
<p>The following morning the suspects were released on
bail, and that afternoon two unassuming individuals, unknown
to the attendant in charge, called at the undertaker&rsquo;s establishment
and claiming they were from the coroner&rsquo;s office,
demanded the bodies for the purpose of holding an inquest
on them. The two bodies were released without hesitation.
Upon the arrival of the proprietor, when told of the incident
he contacted the coroner&rsquo;s office only to learn that the bodies
in question had not been sent for or been seen. Inasmuch
as there were no corpi delicti as evidence, no case could be
made out against Old Cunny, and he and his confederates
were released.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In the CINCINNATI DAILY GAZETTE, under date of
November 22, 1870, is a news item to the effect that a body
delivered to one of the medical colleges of that city &ldquo;was
stolen by the enterprising sawbones of a rival establishment
during the night. Old Cunny was therefore compelled to
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
make another midnight expedition last night much to his disgust&mdash;not
that he dislikes the business, but that he is now
getting old, and that which was once pleasant recreation has
now become somewhat of a burden.&rdquo; Wonder if it ever occurred
to that reporter that there is a strong likelihood that
Old Cunny himself might have been the guilty one who &ldquo;stole&rdquo;
the body and re-sold it to a rival institution? Such episodes
were known to occur.</p>
<p>Evidently not all of Old Cunny&rsquo;s contraband was destined
for the anatomy laboratories in Cincinnati, as judged
from a news item in the CINCINNATI DAILY GAZETTE,
dated January 20, 1870. According to this news report &ldquo;Cunningham,
the resurrectionist, deposited a box at the U. S.
express office marked &lsquo;Glass with care, C. O. D. Dr. M. P.
Hayden, Leavenworth, Kan.&rsquo; Suspicions of the company&rsquo;s
agents were excited, and when they opened the box it contained
the body of a negro woman prepared for the dissecting knife
and served up in a sack. The freight was returned to Mr.
Cunningham.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">A GHASTLY REVENGE</span></h2>
<p>Old Cunny&rsquo;s villainous nature is well illustrated in a
story told of him when he took ghastly revenge on some frolicking
medical students who had played some sort of a joke
on him. According to the story, he became so enraged with
the students that he knowingly dug up the body of a smallpox
victim which he delivered to the dissecting room, as a result
of which the unprotected students promptly became infected
with the disease.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Although Cunningham probably was booked in the police
records of Cincinnati more often than any other of its citizens
during his time, not all of the charges brought against
him were based on his resurrection activities. As mentioned
previously, he was addicted to strong liquor, and because
of that weakness he was occasionally booked on charges
of drunkenness and disturbance of the peace. Thus, for example,
in the CINCINNATI DAILY GAZETTE on January 13,
1870, we read that &ldquo;William Cunningham, an express driver,
who will be remembered by all who have attended the medical
colleges in this city, managed to get arrested last night.
He first fired his brain with whisky then fired off an enormous
revolver on Central Avenue.&rdquo; The report goes on to
say that he had on his person more than seventy dollars in
greenbacks, a sum according to the write-up slightly larger
than usual for station-house visitors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="904" />
<p class="pcap">... fired off an enormous revolver....</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Evidence that Old Cunny enjoyed a lucrative income
from his nefarious business is furnished by an editorial in
the CINCINNATI DAILY ENQUIRER on February 21, 1871.
It comments upon the poor conditions of the Wesleyan Cemetery
in that city, pointing out that &ldquo;several of the graves
look as though they had been robbed by a professional body-snatcher.
The heads of the graves about two feet square in
area are sunken lower than the rest.... Indeed, after a consideration
of the ease with which any one can get into the
grounds, it is not a matter of surprise if Cunny or some
other professional has often paid nocturnal visits to the Wesleyan
and obtained subjects for the various medical colleges.&rdquo;
It then goes on to say that &ldquo;When men of small
means, and endowed with a bare living, can afford to purchase
fine residences and building sites, can drive home
four-hundred dollar carriages right from the manufacturer,
things do begin to look somewhat suspicious.&rdquo; It may be
assumed that, by inference, the editorial writer refers to none
other than William Cunningham.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">&ldquo;THE CHAMPION RESURRECTIONIST CAUGHT&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>As is the usual fate of all culprits who fail to learn
that &ldquo;crime does not pay,&rdquo; the law finally caught up with the
hero of this tale. Old Cunny&rsquo;s end is best described in a
feature article which appeared in the August 31, 1871, issue
of the CINCINNATI DAILY ENQUIRER, entitled &ldquo;The
Champion Resurrectionist Caught.&rdquo; Under this caption it is
pointed out that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows &lsquo;Old Cunny,&rsquo; the resurrectionist,
whose occupation for many years past has been to supply the
various medical colleges of the city with subjects for dissection,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and, who, it is understood, has amassed quite a
handsome competency at his contraband employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve or fifteen years ago, when he was in the prime
of manhood, Cunny was so adroit and careful, though daring
withal, that he carried on the business almost without molestation.
But of late years his increasing age and infirmity
have several times thrown him into the hands of the officers,
though by singular good fortune he has hitherto escaped punishment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The news item then goes on to state that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday morning about one o&rsquo;clock, the attention of
two police officers was attracted by the figure of an old man
driving at a rapid rate down a Cincinnati street followed by
a crowd of men and boys running after him, hooting and hollowing
&lsquo;Stop him! Shoot him!&rsquo; and the like. The officers
called him to stop, but he only laid whip to his horse and
drove past them. The horse, however, was lame, and the
load in the wagon seemingly heavy and after a short race one
of the officers grasped the bridle while the other took charge
of the driver. The driver was Old Cunny, who, returning
after a night&rsquo;s work at his ghoulish employment, had been
delayed on his road home by an accident to his vehicle. In
the wagon was found a sack containing the dead body of a man,
while a similar package on the seat beside him contained the
remains of a child, a boy ten or twelve years old.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cunny was taken to the police station and ensconced
behind iron bars; his contraband was put in charge of the
coroner, and he entered a plea of not guilty. After paying
bail to the sum of $300.00, he was released from custody to
answer to the charge of illegal possession of dead human
bodies at the next session of the Common Pleas Court.</p>
<p>On September 12, 1871, there appears a statement in
the same newspaper to the effect that Cunningham had been
indicted on five counts. No record could be found as to
whether or not he appeared in Court to answer these charges
or whether or not he was found guilty and sentenced. The
next news we hear of him is in the October 23, 1871, issue
of the newspaper in which it is mentioned for the first time
that Old Cunny was a patient in the Cincinnati Hospital and
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
that he &ldquo;regarded the announcement of his demise yesterday
morning as an error.&rdquo; The news item goes on to say that
he was suffering a temporary derangement of his system
from the use of too much poor whisky but that he promised
to be out in a few days ready for business, which he claimed
was being sadly neglected during his illness.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">AN APPROPRIATE FINIS</span></h2>
<p>It is not known whether or not he was able to fulfill his
promise. However, it is known from the announcement in
the local daily press that Old Cunny met his demise on November
2, 1871, at the age of 64.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> According to Juettner
that was not the end, however, of his earthly remains; for
on authority of this author, prior to Cunningham&rsquo;s death, he
had sold his body to the Medical College of Ohio, and when
he died it was turned over to that institution by his &ldquo;bereaved
widow&rdquo; who managed to get an additional $5.00 bill for his
giant carcass. This author also made the claim that, at the
time when he wrote the statement, &ldquo;the skeleton of Old Cunny
is to this day the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>
in the museum of the
Medical College of Ohio.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Juettner&rsquo;s claim as to the eventual fate of Old Cunny&rsquo;s
skeleton has been verified by a statement received recently
from the Department of Anatomy, University of Cincinnati,
College of Medicine, where the skeleton is now housed.</p>
<p>This is not the last we hear of Old Cunny&rsquo;s widow, who
has been described as being &ldquo;a bony, brawny-jawed Irish
woman, with a mouth like an alligator.&rdquo; She had evidently
taken up Old Cunny&rsquo;s business where he left off, judging from
a news item that appeared in the OHIO STATE JOURNAL of
December 6, 1878, under the date line Cincinnati, December
5. According to this news report, a gang of resurrectionists
consisting of five persons was arrested in that city,
included among which were two women, one of whom was
&ldquo;the widow of Cunningham, of former notoriety in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon such depraved characters as the Cunninghams
did the anatomists of the nineteenth century have to rely for
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the procurement of their anatomical subjects prior to the
passage of anatomy laws, which made it unnecessary to resort
to the nefarious and odious practice of body snatching.
Inasmuch as the identities of the procurers and of the bodies
which they delivered to the medical colleges were unknown
to the anatomy professors, all business transactions having
been carried on through an intermediary person&mdash;usually
the janitor&mdash;the professors were consequently absolved of
being a principal or accessory to the crime of body snatching.
Granted that anyone who would be so wanton as to make
his livelihood by desecrating places of human sepulture was
deserving of all the villifying names hurled at him; nevertheless
we should not lose sight of the fact that the sins of
commission of the ghoulish resurrectionists were made possible
by sins of omission of the public and of their representatives
in the legislative halls, who refused for so many
years to support an anatomy law, which, as time has proved,
abolished the need for resurrectionists.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
